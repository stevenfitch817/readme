My name is stevenfitch, I am 19 years old, 1.36 meters tall, 30 centimeters in weight, and I am in the third grade. I am a lively and cheerful boy. I like sports. Running, high jump, long jump, and playing are all my strengths. I also participated in running track training. Now I am popular. Teachers often praise me for playing well. Also very proud. I also like to learn, not only to master the book knowledge well, but also to read some extracurricular books, fairy tales, classical celebrities, social sciences, celebrity stories, and historical stories. I especially like books about weapons. I like airplanes, tanks, and submachine guns very much. I am ready to study hard and will find a super plane to defend the motherland. I also like painting, music, and calligraphy. I also play the saxophone well.# readme
